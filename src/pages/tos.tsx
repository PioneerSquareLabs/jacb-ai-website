                compile Aggregated Data; and (d) as otherwise required by

                available Customer Data to LLMs and, as applicable, the
                providers of such LLMs, in accordance with this Agreement.

                collect, generate, access, use, disclose, transmit, store, host,

              <p>
                4.3. <strong>Feedback.</strong> If Customer provides JACoB with
                recommendations, suggestions, or other feedback relating to the
                Services, or any other JACoB products or services (“Feedback”),
                Customer hereby grants JACoB an unrestricted, perpetual,
                irrevocable, non- exclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free right and
                license to freely use, disclose, reproduce, license, distribute,
                and otherwise exploit the Feedback in any manner and for any
                purpose, including to improve the Services and to commercialize
                the Feedback in any JACoB product, technology, service,

                obligation to provide Customer with attribution or compensation
                for any Feedback provided to JACoB.
              </p>
              <p>
                4.4. <strong>Third-Party Platforms.</strong> JACoB may make
                available one or more integrations through the Services that
                enable Customer to import or export information to or from
                Customer’s account on a Third-Party Platform, including through
                integrations with the entities that are listed on our website,
                as may be updated by JACoB from time to time. JACoB may enable
                Customer to import or export such information, including
                Customer Data, by linking Customer’s account on the Services
                with an account on the Third- Party Platform. If Customer
                directs JACoB to transmit data to, or receive data from, a
                Third-Party Platform on Customer’s behalf (including by enabling
                the applicable integration in the settings of the Services),
                then Customer authorizes JACoB to collect, access, use,
                disclose, transfer, transmit, store, or otherwise process
                (“Process”) any such data (including Customer Data) in
                connection with the applicable integration, in a manner
                consistent with the functionality of the Services requested by
                Customer and the permissions granted to JACoB by the relevant
                integration (which Processing may include performing queries on
                the data held by the Third-Party Platform). Use of Third-Party
                Platforms is subject to Customer’s agreement with the relevant
                provider and not this Agreement. JACoB does not control and has
                no liability for any Third-Party Platform, including their
                security, functionality, operation, availability, or
                interoperability with the Services or how the Third-Party
                Platforms, including any LLMs, or their providers, use Customer
                Data or Customer’s Tasks.
              </p>
              <p>
                4.5. <strong>LLMs; Outputs.</strong> JACoB uses LLMs to provide
                the Services and generate the Output. Before using the Services,
                Customer should review and ensure it complies with the
                acceptable use policies of the LLMs, including the LLMs and
                applicable policies, which JACoB will make available to Customer
                upon Customer’s request. Customer is responsible for its
                compliance with such policies, and JACoB has no responsibility
                for any interruptions to the Services caused by Customer’s
                violation of such policies. JACoB may suspend or terminate
                Customer’s use of all or part of the Services if JACoB becomes
                aware that Customer is violating any such policy. Customer
                acknowledges and agrees that JACoB is not responsible for any
                output, content, or other materials generated or produced by the
                LLMs. Outputs are generated through machine learning processes
                and are not tested, verified, endorsed, or guaranteed to be
                accurate, complete, or current by JACoB. Customer should
                independently review and verify all Outputs as to
                appropriateness for any or all Customer use cases or
                applications.
              </p>
              <p>
                4.6. <strong>Customer Obligations.</strong> By enabling an
                integration with a Third-Party Platform on the Services,
                Customer represents and warrants that Customer has the necessary
                licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to authorize JACoB
                to access Customer’s Customer Data on such Third-Party Platform
                and exercise the licenses granted by Customer in this Agreement
                in the manner contemplated by JACoB, the Services, and this
                Agreement. Customer will be responsible for enabling JACoB to
                access and use each item of Customer Data, including to the
                extent they are stored on a Third-Party Platform. Customer
                retains responsibility for its contractual obligations with
                respect to Customer Data, including JACoB’s access to the
                materials on a Third-Party Platform. Customer is responsible for
                its Customer Data, including its content and accuracy. Customer
                represents and warrants that it has made all disclosures,
                provided all notices, and has obtained all rights, consents, and
                permissions necessary for JACoB to process and use the Customer
                Data as set forth in this Agreement without violating or
                infringing applicable laws, third-party rights, or terms or
                policies that apply to the Customer Data.

              <p>
                <strong>Fees and Payment</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                5.1. <strong>Fees</strong> Fees for the Services will be
                identified by JACoB at the time that Customer orders or signs up
                for the Services (“Fees”). Before paying any fees, Customer will
                have an opportunity to review and accept the Fees that Customer
                will be charged. Unless JACoB has specified otherwise, all Fees
                will be paid in US dollars. Any payment of Fees not made within
                30 days from the date of the invoice will be considered a late
                payment, except that if Customer pays the overdue amount within
                a grace period of 10 days after the invoice due date, Customer
                will not be deemed to have breached this Agreement. All late
                payments will be subject to a service charge of 1.5% per month
                or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less, and
                Customer will also be responsible for Fees or charges that are
                incidental to any chargeback or collection of any the unpaid
                amount including any collection Fees. All Fees and other
                expenses are non-refundable. Customer is responsible for any
                sales, use, GST, value-added, withholding, or similar taxes or
                levies that apply to Customer’s orders, whether domestic or
                foreign, other than JACoB’s income tax (“Taxes”). Fees are
                exclusive of all Taxes.
              </p>
              <p>
                5.2. <strong>Authorization.</strong> Customer authorizes JACoB
                to charge all sums for the orders that Customer makes and any
                level of Services that Customer selects as described in this
                Agreement or published by JACoB, including all applicable Taxes,
                to the payment method specified in Customer’s account. If
                Customer pay any Fees with a credit card, then JACoB may seek
                pre-authorization of Customer’s credit card account prior to
                Customer’s purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and
                has the necessary funds or credit available to cover the
                purchase. If Customer’s payment method is no longer valid at the
                time a renewal Fee is due, then JACoB reserves the right to
                delete Customer’s account and any information or Customer Data
                associated with such account without any liability to Customer.
                In order to process payments, JACoB uses Stripe, a third-party
                payment processor. Customer’s payments will be processed by
                Stripe (<a href="https://stripe.com/">https://stripe.com/</a>)
                and is subject to Stripe’s privacy policy at (
                <a href="https://link.com/privacy">https://link.com/privacy</a>)
                and their terms of service at (
                <a href="https://stripe.com/legal/consumer">
                  https://stripe.com/legal/consumer
                </a>
                ).
              </p>
              <p>
                5.3. <strong>Pricing.</strong> JACoB reserves the right to
                determine pricing for the Services. JACoB will make current
                pricing information for the Services available to Customer in
                advance of Customer’s order, and may change pricing for any
                renewal term of any order or for any new order at any time.
                JACoB may make promotional offers with different features and
                different pricing to any of JACoB’s other customers. These
                promotional offers, unless made to Customer, will not apply to
                Customer.
              </p>
              <p>
                5.4. <strong>Renewal Fees.</strong> Fees for Renewal Terms (as
                defined below) are at JACoB’s then-current Fees at the time of
                such renewal regardless of any discounted pricing in a prior
                subscription or promotional offers previously extended to
                Customer.
              </p>
              <p>
                5.5. <strong>Free Trials.</strong> JACoB may offer limited
                access to the Services for free (a “Free Trial”). During a Free
                Trial, certain features of the Services may not be available and
                Customer may only be permitted to submit a set number to Tasks
                before the Free Trial expires. The number of permitted Tasks
                during the Free Trial and any other limitations on Customer’s
                use of the Services during the Free Trial will be communicated
                when Customer first accesses the Free Trial. Unless JACoB has
                specified otherwise, Free Trial will begin on the date that
                Customer first accesses the Free Trial and ends when Customer
                has used all of the permitted Tasks. When the Free Trial ends,
                Customer may lose access to the any Customer Data that Customer
                (or its users) submits to the Services during the Free Trial.
                NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT,
                JACOB PROVIDES NO WARRANTY, INDEMNITY, OR SUPPORT FOR FREE
                TRIALS, AND JACOB’S LIABILITY FOR TRIALS WILL NOT EXCEED US
                $50.00.

                <strong>Term and Termination</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                6.1. <strong>Term.</strong> The term of this Agreement commences
                on the Effective Date, will continue for an initial term equal
                to the duration of the subscription purchased by Customer upon
                sign up (the “Initial Term”), and will thereafter automatically
                renew for successive periods of equal length to the Initial Term
                (each, a “Renewal Term”), unless earlier terminated as expressly
                set forth in this Agreement (collectively, the “Term”). Either
                party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice
                to the other party 30 days prior to the date of any such
                automatic renewal.
              </p>
              <p>
                6.2. <strong>Termination for Material Breach.</strong> If either
                party fails to perform any of its material obligations under
                this Agreement, the other party may terminate this Agreement by
                giving 30 days prior written notice, provided that the matters
                set forth in such notice are not cured to the terminating
                party’s reasonable satisfaction within the 30-day period. For
                clarity, any failure by Customer to timely pay to JACoB any
                amounts owing under this Agreement will constitute a material
                breach of this Agreement. If Customer fails to timely pay any
                Fees, JACoB may, without limitation to any of its other rights
                or remedies, suspend Customer’s access to the Services until it
                receives all amounts due.
              </p>
              <p>
                6.3. <strong>Post-Termination Obligations.</strong> If this
                Agreement is terminated for any reason: (a) Customer will pay to
                JACoB any Fees, compensation, or other amounts that have accrued
                prior to the effective date of the termination; and (b) any and
                all liabilities accrued prior to the effective date of the
                termination will survive. The provisions set forth in the
                following sections, and any other right or obligation of the
                parties in this Agreement that, by its nature, should survive
                termination or expiration of this Agreement, will survive any
                expiration or termination of this Agreement: 4.2 (Usage Data;
                Aggregated Data), 4.3 (Feedback), 6.3 (Post- Termination
                Obligations), 7.2 (Disclaimer), 9 (Limitation of Liability), 10
                (Confidentiality), and 11 (General Terms). JACoB may continue to
                access and use Customer Data for 90 days following expiration or
                termination of this Agreement for the purpose of compiling and
                creating Aggregated Data and deriving or generating Usage Data.
                It is Customer’s sole responsibility to save copies of Customer
                Data prior to any expiration or termination of this Agreement.
                JACoB has no obligation to make available to Customer copies of
                Customer Data upon expiration or termination of this Agreement.
                Promptly following the end of the 90 day period, JACoB will
                delete or return all Customer Data including all copies, whether
                in physical or electronic format, except as required by law to
                be retained.

                executed and delivered and constitutes a valid and binding
                agreement enforceable against such party in accordance with its

                performance of this Agreement; and (c) the execution, delivery,

                REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES STATED IN THIS SECTION 7
                (WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMER), JACOB MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR
                WARRANTY OF ANY KIND WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED (EITHER IN FACT OR
                BY OPERATION OF LAW), OR STATUTORY, AS TO ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER.
                JACOB EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
                MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUALITY,
                ACCURACY, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. JACOB DOES NOT WARRANT
                AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH THE ENJOYMENT OF THE SERVICES. JACOB
                IS NOT LIABLE FOR ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR MISTAKES IN CUSTOMER
                DATA OR CUSTOMER’S USE OF ANY OUTPUT PROVIDED BY THE SERVICES
                AND ANY ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INACCURACIES IN SUCH INFORMATION.
                JACOB DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES ARE ERROR-FREE OR THAT
                OPERATION OF THE SERVICES WILL BE SECURE OR UNINTERRUPTED. JACOB
                EXERCISES NO CONTROL OVER AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY
                ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THE CUSTOMER’S USE OF THE SERVICES.

                <strong>Indemnification</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                8.1. <strong>Indemnification by JACoB</strong>. JACoB will
                defend Customer from and against any third-party claim to the
                extent alleging that a Service as operated by JACoB, when used
                by Customer as permitted under this Agreement infringes or
                misappropriates a third-party’s U.S. patent, copyright,
                trademark, or trade secret, and will indemnify and hold harmless
                Customer against any damages and costs awarded against Customer
                (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) or agreed in a settlement
                by JACoB resulting from the claim. In response to an actual or
                potential infringement or misappropriation claim or otherwise
                relating to violation of intellectual property rights, if
                required by settlement or injunction or as JACoB determines
                necessary to avoid material liability, JACoB may at its option:
                (a) procure rights for Customer’s continued use of the Services;
                (b) replace or modify the allegedly infringing portion of the
                Services to avoid infringement or misappropriation without
                reducing the Service’s overall functionality; or (c) terminate
                the Agreement and refund to Customer any pre-paid, unused fees
                for the terminated portion of the Term. JACoB’s obligations in
                this Section 8.1 (Indemnification by JACoB) do not apply: (a) to
                infringement or misappropriation resulting from Customer’s
                modification of Services or use of Services in combination with
                items not provided by JACoB (including Third-Party Platforms);
                (b) to infringement resulting from Services other than the most
                recent release; (c) to unauthorized use of Services; (d) if
                Customer settles or makes any admissions about a claim without
                JACoB’s prior consent; or (e) to free or evaluation use of the
                Services.
              </p>
              <p>
                8.2 <strong>Indemnification by Customer</strong>. Customer will
                defend JACoB from any actual or threatened third party claim
                arising out of or based upon Customer’s use of the Services,
                Customer's breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement, or
                Customer’s dispute with any Third-Party Platform (including any
                LLM). Customer will indemnify JACoB against: (a)&nbsp;all
                damages, costs, and attorneys’ fees finally awarded against
                JACoB in any proceeding under this Section 8.2 (Indemnification
                by Customer); (b)&nbsp;all out-of-pocket costs (including
                reasonable attorneys’ fees) reasonably incurred by JACoB in
                connection with the defense of such proceeding (other than
                attorneys’ fees and costs incurred without Customer’s consent
                after Customer has accepted defense of such claim); and
                (c)&nbsp;if any proceeding arising under this Section 8.2
                (Indemnification by Customer) is settled, Customer will pay any
                amounts to any third party agreed to by Customer in settlement
                of any such claims.
              </p>
              <p>
                8.3 <strong>Procedure</strong>. The indemnifying party’s
                obligations in this Section 8 (Indemnification) are subject to
                it receiving: (a) prompt written notice of the claim; (b) the
                exclusive right to control and direct the investigation,
                defense, and settlement of the claim; and (c) all reasonably
                necessary cooperation of the indemnified party, at the
                indemnifying party’s expense for reasonable out-of-pocket costs.
                The indemnifying party may not settle any claim without the
                indemnified party’s prior consent if settlement would require
                the indemnified party to admit fault or take or refrain from
                taking any action (other than relating to use of the Services,
                when JACoB is the indemnifying party). The indemnified party may
                participate in a claim with its own counsel at its own expense.
              </p>
              <p>
                8.4 <strong>Exclusive Remedy</strong>. This Section 8
                (Indemnification) sets out Customer’s exclusive remedy and
                JACoB’s entire liability regarding infringement or
                misappropriation of third-party intellectual property rights.

                PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF
                LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS
                TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS OF THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES.
                THIS ALLOCATION IS REFLECTED IN THE PRICING OFFERED BY JACOB TO
                CUSTOMER AND IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN
                BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND
                INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. THE
                LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9 (LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY) WILL
                APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY

                disclosed to a party during the term of this Agreement and that
                such party knows or has reason to know is confidential,
                proprietary, or trade secret information of the disclosing
                party. Confidential Information does not include any information
                that: (a) was known to the receiving party prior to receiving
                the same from the disclosing party in connection with this
                Agreement; (b) is independently developed by the receiving party
                without use of or reference to the Confidential Information of
                the disclosing party; (c) is acquired by the receiving party
                from another source without restriction as to use or disclosure;
                or (d) is or becomes part of the public domain through no fault
                or action of the receiving party. Usage Data and Aggregated Data

              <p>
                10.2. <strong>Restricted Use and Nondisclosure.</strong> During
                and after the term of this Agreement, each party will: (a) use
                the other party’s Confidential Information only to fulfill its
                obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement; (b)
                not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to a
                third party unless the third party must access the Confidential
                Information to perform in accordance with this Agreement; and
                (c) maintain the secrecy of, and protect from unauthorized use
                and disclosure, the other party’s Confidential Information to
                the same extent (but using no less than a reasonable degree of
                care) that it protects its own Confidential Information of a
                similar nature.
              </p>
              <p>
                10.3. <strong>Required Disclosure.</strong> If either party is
                required by law to disclose the Confidential Information or the
                terms of this Agreement, the disclosing party must give prompt
                written notice of such requirement before such disclosure, to
                the extent permitted by law, and assist the non-disclosing party
                in obtaining an order protecting the Confidential Information
                from public disclosure.
              </p>
              <p>
                10.4. <strong>Return of Materials.</strong> Upon the termination
                or expiration of this Agreement, or upon earlier request, each
                party will deliver to the other all Confidential Information
                that it may have in its possession or control. Notwithstanding
                the foregoing, neither party will be required to return
                materials that it must retain in order to receive the benefits
                of this Agreement or properly perform in accordance with this
                Agreement.

                <strong>General Terms</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                11.1. <strong>Modification.</strong> JACoB may revise this
                Agreement from time to time with notice to Customer (email or
                posting on JACoB’s website being sufficient). Revisions will be
                effective immediately except that, for existing users, material
                revisions will be effective upon the start of Customer’s next
                Renewal Term. We may require that Customer accept the revised
                Agreement in order to continue to use the Services. If you do
                not agree to the revised Agreement, then you should discontinue
                your use of the Services. Except as expressly permitted in this
                Section 11.1 (Modification), this Agreement may be amended only
                by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of
                the parties to this Agreement.
              </p>
              <p>
                11.2. <strong>Relationship.</strong> JACoB will be and act as an
                independent contractor (and not as the agent or representative
                of Customer) in the performance of this Agreement. This
                Agreement will not be interpreted or construed as: (a) creating
                or evidencing any association, joint venture, partnership, or
                franchise between the parties; (b) imposing any partnership or
                franchise obligation or liability on either party; or (c)
                prohibiting or restricting JACoB’s performance of any services
                for any third party or the provision of products to any third
                party. Customer must not represent to anyone that Customer is an
                agent of JACoB or is otherwise authorized to bind or commit
                JACoB in any way without JACoB’s prior authorization.
              </p>
              <p>
                11.3. <strong>Assignability.</strong> JACoB may assign this
                Agreement and all rights granted under this Agreement at any
                time without notice or consent. Customer may not assign its
                right, duties, or obligations under this Agreement without
                JACoB’s prior written consent. If consent is given, this
                Agreement will bind Customer’s successors and assigns. Any
                attempt by Customer to transfer its rights, duties, or
                obligations under this Agreement except as expressly provided in
                this Agreement is void.
              </p>
              <p>
                11.4. <strong>Subcontractors.</strong> JACoB may utilize a
                subcontractor or other third party to perform its duties under
                this Agreement so long as JACoB remains responsible for all of
                its obligations under this Agreement.
              </p>
              <p>
                11.5. <strong>Reference.</strong> Subject to Section 10
                (Confidentiality), Customer hereby grants JACoB a right to use
                Customer’s name and logo on JACoB’s web site and in marketing
                and advertising materials, subject to compliance with Customer’s
                brand guidelines or other specifications regarding logo usage.
              </p>
              <p>

                send all notices to Customer at the email or other contact
                information provided by Customer when signing up for the
                Services.
              </p>
              <p>
                11.7. <strong>Force Majeure.</strong> JACoB will not be liable
                for, or be considered to be in breach of or default under this
                Agreement on account of, any delay or failure to perform as
                required by this Agreement as a result of any cause or condition
                beyond JACoB’s reasonable control, so long as JACoB uses
                commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or remove such causes
                of non-performance.
              </p>
              <p>
                11.8. <strong>Governing Law.</strong> This Agreement will be
                interpreted, construed, and enforced in all respects in
                accordance with the local laws of the State of Washington,
                without reference to its choice of law rules and not including
                the provisions of the 1980 U.N. Convention on Contracts for the
                International Sale of Goods. Each party hereby irrevocably
                consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal,
                state, and local courts in King County, Washington in connection
                with any action arising out of or in connection with this
                Agreement.
              </p>
              <p>
                11.9. <strong>Commencing Legal Action.</strong> An action for
                breach of this Agreement or any other action otherwise arising
                out of this Agreement must be commenced within one year from the
                date the right, claim, demand, or cause of action first occurs
                or be barred forever.
              </p>
              <p>
                11.10. <strong>Waiver.</strong> The waiver by either party of
                any breach of any provision of this Agreement does not waive any
                other breach. The failure of any party to insist on strict
                performance of any covenant or obligation in accordance with
                this Agreement will not be a waiver of such party’s right to
                demand strict compliance in the future, nor will the same be
                construed as a novation of this Agreement.
              </p>
              <p>
                11.11. <strong>Severability.</strong> If any part of this
                Agreement is found to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, the
                remaining portions of this Agreement will remain in full force
                and effect. If any material limitation or restriction on the use
                of the Services under this Agreement is found to be illegal,
                unenforceable, or invalid, Customer’s right to use the Services
                will immediately terminate.
              </p>
              <p>
                11.12. <strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> This Agreement is the
                final and complete expression of the agreement between these
                parties regarding Customer’s use of the Services. This Agreement
                supersedes, and the terms of this Agreement govern, all previous
                oral and written communications regarding these matters, all of
                which are merged into this Agreement. No employee, agent, or
                other representative of JACoB has any authority to bind JACoB
                with respect to any statement, representation, warranty, or
                other expression unless the same is specifically set forth in
                this Agreement. No usage of trade or other regular practice or
                method of dealing between the parties will be used to modify,
                interpret, supplement, or alter the terms of this Agreement.
