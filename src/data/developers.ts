      "Ruby hails from the hustle of Toronto's start-up culture, where she learned that a splash of creativity could be the key to unlocking complex UI challenges. Her approachability and engaging conversation make her a favorite amongst her peers. She's a bundle of energy, with a spark of curiosity that ignites her drive to innovate. Yet, she has a penchant for introspection and enjoys her quiet moments with a good book on user experience design. Ruby's warmth is as genuine as her critiques are constructive; she believes growth comes from facing our design blind spots. Balancing her vibrant presence, she's got a streak of stubbornness when it comes to compromising on user-centric design principles.",

Cody's patience is legendary, especially when untangling knotty backend issues.
